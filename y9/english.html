    <p>* = WAM = Weighting adjusted mark. Generally, these can be ignored. Only necessary for calculating grades (i.e. A, B) or rankings. Add up all WAMs, then divide by 3 or 4 for an overall mark for a subject. WAM formula = Mark * Weighting * No. of ASTs. </p>

    <p class="font-bold">Some thoughts:</p>
    English. My, for the most part, worst subject. It's not that I hate it or find it boring. Actually, that depends on the task. The Gothic Horror task was boring as all hell (9/10), whereas Animal Farm was a little lower on the boring scale (7.5/10). It's just that I struggle with English. In all other subjects, I'm within, at the very lowest, the top ~20% of the cohort. But English bucks this trend. Even since Primary, English has been my very worst subject. That doesn't mean I'm bad at it by any means, just take a look at my NAPLAN results from Y3-7. Maths was in the triangle, and the English exams were in the band below. I was above the average nonetheless, no matter what my parents said. Obviously, they expressed their disappointment, even in maths, but thereâ€™s no making them happy, at least with their current mindset. Anyways, back to Y9 English. Generally, I do better in exams than with hand-in assignments, a trend that started to emerge in Y8. The first two assessments of Y8, a hand in essay for the Giver and a multimodal about an anime film, I didnâ€™t perform well in. Both of those scored in the low seventies or even high sixties. But in the next two, exams analysing Shakespeare and a narrative exam, I scored in the nineties for both. Even with just two assessments completed this year so far, the same trend has been observed again. Nice. But I still hate English. Part of this comes down to how hard it is to study for English. Until you get the notification, youâ€™re in the dark. You can't study with past papers, nor can You use any other tools at your disposal. Insert textbook or anything to guide you, and analysis is a skill that is only built in the very early stages of high school. As a result, you are still pretty new to it and that makes things a lot harder. Another reason why I tend to struggle English is the cause of my lack of willingness to ask questions. And get feedback when I need help. Now I have started to reverse this trend very slightly. But still. It's nowhere near where I want it to be. So basically, I just really hate English and sometimes specially like narrative or persuasive some people, they just really don't like it. And that sort of uncertainty and that sort of variation when it comes to English, especially with who's marking. That's why people don't like it and I guess that's part of why I don't like it. I guess I should also add that when it comes to English assessments, I prepare for them very little, often just a couple days before. I rush them and utilise my time in the worst way possible. But I guess that's how it goes. (written with dictation)
