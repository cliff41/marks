    <p>* = WAM = Weighting adjusted mark. Generally, these can be ignored. Only necessary for calculating grades (i.e. A, B) or rankings. Add up all WAMs, then divide by 3 or 4 for an overall mark for a subject. WAM formula = Mark * Weighting * No. of ASTs. </p>

    <p class="font-bold">Some thoughts:</p>
    Science. I've got a lot of mixed emotions about this subject, especially in regards to if it even is necessary. I mean, I could pose the same question that I did with calculus. When are you going to know how many electrons fit in each electron shell, or what chemical reaction creates sodium chloride? Yes, these are basic questions, but the point still stays the same. For over 95% of us, most branches of science play a negligible, if not miniscule part in our life. As for the assessments? Well, they are also somewhat annoying, but I do sense some sort of reality, in at least some of them. <br> <br> Wow. That first assessment task. I remember hearing everyone complain, languishing thier frustration about how they "only gave us two weeks" to complete the assessment. In all fairness, I did have to rush a solid bunch. I spent most of the two weekends I had typing and researching for this one project. I spent so many hours. When I heard my friends from the lower classes say that the finished the entire report in just three hours, I thought that I was doing something wrong, that I was incompetent and inefficient, that I was going to get poor marks. Of course, that didn't happen. I got a mark which was a solid chunk better than the average. As Mr Gary often says, "the mark is a reflection of the effort you put in." I remember how stressed I was and how much ambiguity there was surrounding the task. I had too many questions, not enough answers. I'm not gonna blame my teachers for that though. Now of course, this higher mark came at a cost. What was it? Recieving just barely above average on my English video. I allocated so little time to it, so it was nearly a guarantee. And it was becasue of Science. <br> <br> The semester exam was easier than expected, but I wouldn't go as far as too call it easy. I remember walking out of that room after completing the exam in 310. Everyone was saying it was easy as all hell. Except me. I thought I was gonna fail. I thought I was bad at science. I thought I was just, well, dumb. Of course, that didn't turn out to be true. According to outside sources, I placed 5th in the year for that exam. Could be better, but I'll take it. Looking back at the exam, I was surprised that I lost so many marks for the stupidest things. I finished the exam with 20 minutes to go, reviewed my paper multiple times, yet never caught it. (I read a graph wrong) You know, there's a reason why the average was still only 66%. Now, just because I was humbler and did better doesn't mean anything. Still, I do think science is a waste of time. That's why I'm brushing up on my leadership and social skills, heavily deprioritising school and academics. What does that mean? Well, it doesn't mean I'm going to learn how to change a tyre and what not. No. It means that I'm gonna do some reading on how I can better my life and be a better person, especially towards others, with some manipulative tricks (thx aaron) snuck in here and there.
