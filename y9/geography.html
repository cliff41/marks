    <p class="font-bold">Some thoughts:</p>
    Maths. If you know me, you know I don't mind maths. If you really know me, you know how much I despise it. Now, the common rule is that the subjects that you find fun are the ones you are the best at. But not in this case. I know how hard maths gets. I've flipped through Year 11 and Year 12 textbooks. What lies within them is something you do not want to see. Trust me. That begs the question: Why do I despise maths right now, in Year 9, despite my results? Well, there's a couple reasons. Personally, I don't find Maths all that useful of a subject frankly. People always make snarky remarks about school and how it's useless and how Maths is the main culprit. These sorts of remarks are generally made by people who are big fans of online influencers such as Andrew Tate. These are the sorts of people who are touting these new unconventional methods of building wealth and income and succeeding in life. And to be honest it's kind of appealing. Now, that doesn't mean I would blindly follow this advice, but when you really think about it from objective perspective, you really start to question, “Do I really need to know calculus?” Now the most obvious answer for 95% of population is no. Unless you're working as a math teacher or in some extremely specialised field which requires a specific branch of mathematics like calculus or number theory, the fact of the matter is you're not gonna need it.  <br> <br> Now, I'm gonna talk about the lessons and exams. As for the lessons, they're pretty boring. I can't quite put my finger on why though. Maybe it was just something about the charisma of Mr Pearce, who is now no longer with us (me). The exams. Well, to put it in the simplest terms possible, the amount of work and study I put in for them was lackluster. No regular study sessions, no endless practice worksheets and exams, none of that. If the teacher put out a couple of practice quizzes, I might have done about four questions from one quiz. I'd also do an extra ~1.5 hours of study the night before the exam. That's it. Now, you must understand that that is not a testament to my intelligence. It's a testament to the difficulty (or lack thereof) in the Australian Curriculum when it comes to math. I don't think this sort of phenomenon is observed anuwhere near as greatly in other subjects. My parents always talk about how hard the maths was back in Hong Kong and such. (Note: Hong Kong is rated as having the fourth highest math levels in the world, just behind Macau, Singapore and China.) As for the next exam, I'm not feeling so good. I haven't put in any effort into study at all, and I some to be getting and infinitely large amount of questions wrong in class and in homework. Of course, I have taken the regular steps to analyse these errors, but still, the fact they are happening when they didn't previously, combined with the fact that the area of focus is the one I am the weakest at means that my crown as 1st in the year when it comes to math, at least in 5.3, could be taken away from me. And I know my parents wouldn't want that.   <br> <br> All that being said, in the event I decide to pursue the HSC, it is likely I will take up MX2. Why? Well, It's pretty straightforward (the reasoning, not the maths). Maths, despite me not having a super enjoyment of the subject, is still at least more enjoyable to me than something like drama or some random subjects like most of the sciences, right? Most of the sciences, I don't think they’re all that important, especially for the fields that I’m planning on getting into. Also, MX2 scales really well. Even if you get a partially OK mark on the exam in the 70s or 80s, it just boosts up your score overall just because of the scaling and how hard this subject is. That doesn’t mean I want to get a score in 70s or 80s, it just means that in the event I do, I won’t become homeless. <br> So, Maths. I don’t mind it, but it’s certainly overrated in the minds of Asians.
